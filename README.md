# C09 Project - project-sheet-music

## App URL

The app is hosted here:

```

```

Unfortunately, uploading the audio, which is arguably the main point of the application, is not working correctly in the production environment. Hopefully this feature can be tested locally, but everything else works fine. Here is how to run the code locally:
1. Checkout the code from the repo.
2. From the project folder, and run `yarn install (or npm install)` to install the backend dependencies
3. Run `yarn start (or npm start)` to start the server
4. From a seperate terminal, navigate into the "client" folder (project-sheet-music/client), and run `yarn install (or npm install)` to install the frontend dependencies
5. In the client folder, run `yarn start (or npm start)` to start the application
